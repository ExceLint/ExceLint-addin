/**
 * Assembles a higher order component based on the following: styles, theme, view, and state.
 * Imposes a separation of concern and centralizes styling processing to increase ease of use and robustness
 * in how components use and apply styling and theming.
 *
 * Automatically merges and applies themes and styles with theme / styleprops having the highest priority.
 * State component, if provided, is passed in props for processing. Props from state / user are automatically processed
 * and styled before finally being passed to view.
 *
 * State components should contain all stateful behavior and should not generate any JSX, but rather simply call the view prop.
 * Views should simply be stateless pure functions that receive all props needed for rendering their output.
 * State component is optional. If state is not provided, created component is essentially a functional stateless component.
 *
 * @param component - component Component options. See IComponent for more detail.
