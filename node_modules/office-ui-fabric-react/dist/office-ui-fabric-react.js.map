Each page's item count is determined by the getItemCountForPage callback\n * if provided by the caller, or 10 as default. Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if\n * provided by the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.\n *\n * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:\n *\n * 1. Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\n * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\n * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\n *\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\n *\n * To optimize glass rendering performance, onShouldVirtualize can be set. When onShouldVirtualize return false,\n * List will run in fast mode (not virtualized) to render all items without any measurements to improve page load time.\n * And we start doing measurements and rendering in virtualized mode when items grows larger than this threshold.\n *\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\n */\nexport class List<T = any> extends React.Component<IListProps<T>, IListState<T>> implements IList {\n  public static defaultProps = {\n    startIndex: 0,\n    onRenderCell: (item: any, index: number, containsFocus: boolean) => <>{(item && item.name) || ''}</>,\n    renderedWindowsAhead: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_AHEAD,\n    renderedWindowsBehind: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_BEHIND,\n  };\n\n  private _root = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>();\n  private _surface = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>();\n  private _pageRefs: Record<string, unknown> = {};\n  private _async: Async;\n  private _events: EventGroup;\n  private _estimatedPageHeight: number;\n  private _totalEstimates: number;\n  private _cachedPageHeights: {\n    [key: string]: {\n      height: number;\n      measureVersion: number;\n    };\n  };\n  private _focusedIndex: number;\n  private _scrollElement: HTMLElement;\n  private _hasCompletedFirstRender: boolean;\n\n  // surface rect relative to window\n  private _surfaceRect: IRectangle | undefined;\n\n  // The visible rect that we're required to render given the current list state.\n  private _requiredRect: IRectangle | null;\n\n  // The visible rect that we're allowed to keep rendered.
