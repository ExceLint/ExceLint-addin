Tooltips supplement content associated with a specific UI component. You can use two components, and each has different props:

- **Tooltip:** A styled tooltip that you can display on a chosen target.
- **TooltipHost:** A tooltip wrapped in a stateful parent. Tooltip will be displayed on hover or focus and removed when focus/hover removed.
