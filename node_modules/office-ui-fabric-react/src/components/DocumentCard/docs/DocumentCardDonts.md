- Don’t use the DocumentCard in views where the user is likely to be performing bulk operations in files, or when the list may get very long. Specifically, if you are showing all the items inside an actual folder, a card may be overkill because the majority of the items in the folder may not have interesting metadata.
- Don’t use the DocumentCard if space is at a premium or you can’t show relevant and timely commands or metadata. Cards are useful because they can expose on-item interactions like “Share” buttons or view counts. If your app does not need this, show a simple grid or list of items instead, which are easier to scan.
