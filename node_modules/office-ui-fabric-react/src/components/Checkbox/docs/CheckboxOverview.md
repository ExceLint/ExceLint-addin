A Checkbox is a UI element that allows users to switch between two mutually exclusive options (checked or unchecked, on or off) through a single click or tap. It can also be used to indicate a subordinate setting or preference when paired with another control.

A Checkbox is used to select or deselect action items. It can be used for a single item or for a list of multiple items that a user can choose from. The control has two selection states: unselected and selected.

Use a single Checkbox for a subordinate setting, such as with a "Remember me?" login scenario or with a terms of service agreement.

For a binary choice, the main difference between a Checkbox and a toggle switch is that the Checkbox is for status and the toggle switch is for action. You can delay committing a Checkbox interaction (as part of a form submit, for example), while you should immediately commit a toggle switch interaction. Also, only Checkboxes allow for multi-selection.

Use multiple Checkboxes for multi-select scenarios in which a user chooses one or more items from a group of choices that are not mutually exclusive.
