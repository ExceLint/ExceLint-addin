- Make sure the label conveys a clear purpose of the button to the user.
- Button labels must describe the action the button will perform and should include a verb. Use concise, specific, self-explanatory labels, usually a single word.
- Buttons should always include a noun if there is any room for interpretation about what the verb operates on.
- Consider the affect localization will have on the button and what will happen to components around it.
- If the buttonâ€™s label content is dynamic, consider how the button will resize and what will happen to components around it.
- Use only a single line of text in the label of the button.
- Expose only one or two buttons to the user at a time, for example, "Accept" and "Cancel". If you need to expose more actions to the user, consider using checkboxes or radio buttons from which the user can select actions, with a single command button to trigger those actions.
- Show only one primary button that inherits theme color at rest state. In the event there are more than two buttons with equal priority, all buttons should have neutral backgrounds.
- "Submit", "OK", and "Apply" buttons should always be styled as primary buttons. When "Reset" or "Cancel" buttons appear alongside one of the above, they should be styled as secondary buttons.
- Default buttons should always perform safe operations. For example, a default button should never delete.
- Use task buttons to cause actions that complete a task or cause a transitional task. Do not use buttons to toggle other UX in the same context. For example, a button may be used to open an interface area but should not be used to open an additional set of components in the same interface.
