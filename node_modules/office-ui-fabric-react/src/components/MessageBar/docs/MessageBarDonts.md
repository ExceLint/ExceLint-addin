- Don’t use paragraphs, long sentences, or special formatting in a MessageBar. The control tries to grow to accommodate all the text and will just result in pushing the user’s main content too low on the view.
- Don’t use buttons when a subtler link will suffice. Reserve the usage of button for when the MessageBar has a single ”hero” action that has vital usefulness to the user at that particular moment. Using more than one button is discouraged.
