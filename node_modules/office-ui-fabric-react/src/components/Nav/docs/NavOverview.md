Navs (also called "left nav" or "navigation pane") provide links to the main areas of an app or a site. In larger configurations, the Nav is always on-screen, usually on the left of the view. In smaller configurations, the Nav may collapse into a skinnier version or be completely hidden until the user taps an icon.
