ExceLint-core is the component functionality for an Excel add-in that
automatically finds formula errors in spreadsheets. It is a product of
research from the [PLASMA lab @ UMass
Amherst](https://plasma-umass.org) and Microsoft Research. The add-in
itself is available here: [ExceLint add-in](https://github.com/plasma-umass/ExceLint-addin).

ExceLint was originally created by [Dan
Barowy](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~dbarowy/) (Williams College),
[Emery Berger](https://www.emeryberger.com/) (UMass Amherst /
Microsoft Research), and [Ben
Zorn](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/zorn/)
(Microsoft Research).
